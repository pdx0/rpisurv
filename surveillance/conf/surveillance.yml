  ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed width of all your camera streams,
  ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched",
  ##if this value exceeds the available width, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
  #fixed_width: 500

  ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed height for all your camera streams,
  ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched",
  ##if this value exceeds the available height, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation
  #fixed_height: 500

  #Rpisurv sends usage stats to it's statistics server to give the rpisurv community an idea how widespread this software is being used
  #No performance impact is measured when using this option, no sensitive data is being sent. All data is anonymised.
  #By default this is false
  update_stats: False

  #By default rpisurv will cache the next screen in the rotation (if more than one screen is configured), to speed up rotation events.
  #However, this action takes up some resources of the raspberry pi.
  #If you do not mind a slower rotate event (slower building up of the screen during a rotate event) and you want to free up some resources, then set this to False
  #This will also speed up first start since no cached screen needs to be started at boot time.
  cache_next_screen: False

  #By default rpisurv checks every 19 seconds since start of rpisurv if it needs to redraw the current running screen
  #interval_check_status: 19

  #By default rpisurv will check memory usage, set to False to skip memory usage check
  #memory_usage_check: True

#These are fallbacks if autodetection fails;
#Normally you do not need to configure these
